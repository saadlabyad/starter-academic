abstract: For each production or utility function, we can define the
  corresponding elasticities of substitution functions; but is the reverse true?
  This paper shows that yes, and that this link is fruitful. By inverting the
  system of partial differential equations defining the elasticities of
  substitution functions, we uncover an analytical formula which encompasses all
  production and utility functions that are admissible in Arrow-Debreu
  equilibria. We highlight the "Constant Elasticities of Substitution Matrix"
  (CESM) class of functions which, unlike the CES functions, does not assume
  uniform substitutability among all pairs of goods. A shortcoming of our method
  is that it permits only to control for local concavity while it is difficult
  to control for global concavity.
